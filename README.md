# Mukti_CV_Academy
This is the academic version of my CV created using the **awesome CV** template from the **vitae** package. The vitae package makes creating and maintaining a Résumé or CV with R Markdown simple. 
It provides a collection of LaTeX and HTML templates, with helpful functions to add content to the documents. I used the template used by [Joo Yong Seo](https://github.com/jooyoungseo/jy_CV), which lets you style your publications using the given csl, print multiple bibliographies on the same document, and  highlight author.
